# Android Image Classifier with Neural Networks API

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of Android's Neural Networks API to run a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a set of images for classification. The application is developed in Kotlin and utilizes native code to implement the neural network functionalities that Android libraries do not directly support in Kotlin.

## Features
- Image picking from the device's storage.
- Image classification using a pre-trained convolutional neural network.
- Display of classification results directly in the app.

## Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- Android SDK with API Level 30 or higher
- Knowledge of Kotlin and native Android development

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Ensure that the Android SDK is set up correctly and that you have the necessary build tools installed.
4. Build the project by selecting 'Build > Make Project'.
5. Run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage
To use the app, simply launch it, select an image from your device, and the app will classify the image using the neural network and display the results.
